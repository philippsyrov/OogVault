  <em>A local search engine for your AI conversations. Never re-ask the same question twice.</em>

## The Problem

You ask Claude how to set up a Docker container. A week later, you ask ChatGPT the same thing. You've already gotten the perfect answer — but it's buried in a conversation you can't find.

Free-tier users lose conversations after limits. Pro users have thousands of chats with no way to search across them. Everyone wastes tokens re-asking questions they've already answered.

## The Solution

**OogVault** is a browser extension that saves your AI conversations locally, makes them instantly searchable, and reminds you when you've already asked something — right before you hit send.

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **One-Click Save** | Save any conversation from Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity with a single click |
| **Instant Search** | Full-text keyword search across all your saved conversations |
| **IDE-Style Autocomplete** | Start typing a question and OogVault shows matching past questions with answer previews — like VS Code autocomplete, but for your brain |
| **Knowledge Base** | Every saved conversation is automatically distilled into Q&A nuggets, auto-categorized by topic (Finance, Science, Tech, and more) |
| **Export as Markdown** | Export individual conversations or your entire knowledge base as `.md` files |
| **Full Backup** | Export everything as a `.json` backup from the Settings page — reimport-ready |

---

### For Normal Humans™ (Chrome / Brave / Edge)

**Step 1** — Download this repo as a ZIP

> Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page → **Download ZIP**

**Step 2** — Unzip it somewhere permanent

**Step 4** — Turn on Developer Mode

> There's a toggle in the top-right corner. Flip it on. Nothing scary happens, we promise.

1. Open about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests welcome! To add support for a new AI platform:

1. Create `content/your-platform.js` following the pattern in `claude.js`
2. Add the URL match pattern to `manifest.json`
3. Implement `extractMessages()` with platform-specific DOM selectors
4. The rest (saving, search, autocomplete, nuggets) works automatically
